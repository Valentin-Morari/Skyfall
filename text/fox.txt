Press X, dummy.
Hey there, green horn!
I'm fox, the one in charge of teaching you.
To move around press
W / A / S / D
That there is the skull enemy.
Nasty little buggers.
To enter combat press
ENTER
Go on, don't be shy.
Very good.
This is a turn based game
But you only have a few seconds to act. 
Think carefully. Plan your moves.
You can still walk, but afterwards comes a delay
If you hold SPACE and walk, you will hop 2 spaces!
But it has an even higher delay.
Learning to mix them both will get you far, literally.
Also, there's icons for each possible action below
They're usefull for knowing when the delay is over
PROTIP: Your delay is only reduced during YOUR turns.
Next up is attacking!
Press the arrow keys to attack.
You're a warrior, so of course you need to get close.
Hold SPACE to do a class-specific STRONG attack.
Once again, the STRONG attack has a bigger delay
But also, better side-effects.
For example, you're a warrior right now.
His strong attack doesn't only dish out huge damage
But also he can charge from up to 3 spaces away!
+ It locks the target so they can't move for some time.
